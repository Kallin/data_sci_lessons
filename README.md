## Data Science Lessons

This project contains a series of lessons designed to get develoeprs up and running
with the basics of data-science/machine-learning as quickly as possible.

## Installation

All of the code in this project should be runnable via docker. Simply run `docker-compose up` from the root of the project
and explore the IPython notebooks.

*Note: The first time you start the project it **could take a very long time** to download the required docker images.
Every subsequent time you start should be nearly instantaneous.*

If you don't have docker installed, you should install it first either for
[Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or
[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).

## Exploring

You should be able to jump into the root of the notebooks straight from github right
[here](work/table_of_contents.ipynb)!
