    "[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) is a very critical library in the Python eco-system. Although we won't be using it directly that often, it is used extensively in both Pandas and Scikit-Learn, which *are* two libraries that we will be seeing a lot while exploring Machine Learning. As such, it's worth learning at least a little bit about it.\n",

Specifically, [chapter 4](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781449323592/ch04.html) has a very thorough rundown of Numpy, and later chapters go into even more in depth."

    "\n",
    "One class lies at the core of Numpy: [numpy.ndarray](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.ndarray.html#). The ND-Array (N-Dimensional array) is an optimized structure for the storage and manipulation of large multi dimensional arrays. Python has native support for lists without Numpy of course, and it is trival to move back and forth between Numpy arrays and Python lists. The actual reasons that Numpy Arrays perform so much better than Python arrays is beyond the scope of this lesson, but some of the more easily understood benefits are worth examining.\n",
