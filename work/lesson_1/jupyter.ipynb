Instead, we mount the project's **./work** directory into **/home/jovyan/work** in the container and **./data** into **/data**. As a result, you should see the contents of your project's **work** and **data** directories present in the Jupyter file-browser, and any changes you make in one place are reflected in the other. Try this now by dropping to a shell in your project's **work** directory and running **touch some_file**. You should see the file appears immediately in the Jupyter file browser. Go ahead and delete the file using the browser.\n",
